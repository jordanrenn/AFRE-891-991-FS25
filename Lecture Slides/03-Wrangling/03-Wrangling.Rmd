# What is "tidy" data?

### Resources:
- [Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) (from the **tidyr** package)
- [Original paper](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) (Hadley Wickham, 2014 JSS)
- [Online Book: R 4 Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)

--

</br>

### Key points:
1. Each .hi-blue[variable] forms a .hi-blue[column].
2. Each .hi-medgrn[observation] forms a .hi-medgrn[row].
3. Each .hi-purple[type of observational unit] forms a .hi-purple[table].

--



Basically, tidy data is more likely to be [long (i.e. narrow) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) than wide format.

# Tidyverse Overview

# Tidyverse vs. base R

One thing to note before we dive into .hi-medgrn[tidyverse]: there is often a .hi-blue[direct correspondence] between a tidyverse command and its base R equivalent. 

These generally follow a `tidyverse::snake_case` vs `base::period.case` rule. E.g. Compare:

| tidyverse  |  base |
|---|---|
| `?readr::read_csv`  | `?utils::read.csv` |
|  `?dplyr::if_else` |  `?base::ifelse` |
|  `?tibble::tibble` |  `?base::data.frame` |

If you call up the above examples, you'll see that the tidyverse alternative typically offers some enhancements or other useful options (and sometimes restrictions) over its base counterpart.

.hi-slate[Remember:] There are (almost) always multiple ways to achieve a single goal in R.

---

# Tidyverse Packages

Let's load the tidyverse meta-package and check the output.
```{r tverse, cache = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

We see that we have actually loaded a number of packages (which could also be loaded individually): **ggplot2**, **tibble**, .hi-slate[dplyr], etc.
- We can also see information about the package versions and some .hi-purple[namespace conflicts].

---

# Tidyverse Packages

The tidyverse actually comes with a .hi-blue[lot more packages] that aren't loaded automatically.
```{r}
tidyverse_packages()
```

We'll use several of these additional packages during the remainder of this course: **haven** for loading Stata files, **lubridate** for working with dates, **rvest** package for webscraping.


---

# Tidyverse Packages

This week we're going to focus on two packages: 
1. [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
2. [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)

These are the workhorse packages for cleaning and wrangling data that you will likely make the most use of (alongside **ggplot2**, which we'll cover more in depth later on)
- Data cleaning and wrangling occupies an .hi-medgrn[inordinate amount of time], no matter where you are in your research career.

name: pipes

# Pipes

<img src = "images/the-treachery-of-images.jpg" width = "600" />

---
#Pipes


The tidyverse .hi-medgrn[pipe operator `%>%`] is one of its .hi-medgrn[coolest features].
- It lets you send (i.e. "pipe") intermediate output to another command.
  - Automatically passes what's "upstream" as the first argument of the "downstream" function
- In other words, it allows us to chain together a sequence of simple operations and thereby implement a more complex operation while preserving legibility
  - Avoids nesting multiple functions, creating many intermediate objects
  
Let's demonstrate with an example.

---
# Pipes

 Suppose you're a big German car fan and want to see average fuel efficiency of their models for 1999-2008. The discrete operations involved are
  1. Load the dataset (`mpg` "loaded" by tidyverse)
  1. Filter the data to Audi and Volkswagen (`filter()`)
  1. Group the data by model (`group_by()`)
  1. Summarise average highway mileage (`summarise()`)
  
--

Without pipes, we would need to 
  1. Assign/reassign intermediate objects to memory after each step (repetitive), or
  2. Nest a lot of functions (hard to read)


---
# Without Pipes: 1. Assign/Reassign

Alternatively, we could .hi-medgrn[assign/reassign] and create .hi-medgrn[intermediate objects].

```{r, eval = F}
cars <- mpg
german_cars <- filter(mpg, manufacturer %in% c("audi", "volkswagen"))
unique(cars$manufacturer)
german_cars_grp <- group_by(german_cars, manufacturer, model)
summarise(german_cars_grp, hwy_mean = mean(hwy), hwy_max = max(hwy))
```
Can add more columns is summarize just by adding more calculations after commas
--

This is stac-ca-to to read and leaves us with a bunch of intermediate objects that we'll need to deal with.

```{r}
rm(cars, german_cars, german_cars_grp)
```
---
# Without Pipes: 2. Nest

The .hi-purple[nested approach] is harder to read and .hi-purple[totally inverts the logical order]

```{r, eval = F}
summarise(group_by(filter(mpg, manufacturer %in% c("audi", "volkswagen")), manufacturer, model), hwy_mean = mean(hwy))
```

  - The final operation comes first!
  - Who wants to read things inside out??

---
# With Pipes

The below line does exactly the same thing through the power of pipes:

```{r, eval = F}
mpg %>% filter(manufacturer %in% c("audi", "volkswagen")) %>% group_by(manufacturer, model) %>% summarise(hwy_mean = mean(hwy))
```
--

With pipes the line reads from left to right, exactly how I thought of the operations in my head. 
  - Take this object (`mpg`), do this (`filter`), then do this (`group_by`), etc.
  


---

# Pipes: Improved Readability

The piped version of the code is .hi-medgrn[even more readable] if we write it .hi-purple[over several lines]. Here it is again and, this time, I'll run it so we can see the output:

```{r pipe}
mpg %>% 
  filter(manufacturer %in% c("audi", "volkswagen")) %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer, model) %>% 
  summarise(hwy_mean = mean(hwy))
```

---

# Pipes: Improved Readability


```{r, eval = FALSE}
mpg %>% 
  filter(manufacturer %in% c("audi", "volkswagen")) %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer, model) %>% 
  summarise(hwy_mean = mean(hwy))
```

At each line, the .hi-purple[upstream object/output] (i.e. the `mpg` df) is being passed into the .hi-medgrn[downstream function] (i.e. `filter()`) as the first argument.

Remember: Using vertical space .hi-pink[costs nothing] and makes for much more readable/writeable code than cramming things horizontally.

--

PS — The pipe is originally from the [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) package (hence the [not-a-pipe image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images)) earlier, which can do some other cool things if you're inclined to explore.

---
name: nativepipe

# The base R pipe: |>

The magrittr pipe has proven so successful and popular, that as of R 4.1.0 the R core team [added a "native" pipe](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/04/base-vs-magrittr-pipe/), denoted `|>`.<sup>1</sup> For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars |> subset(cyl==4) |> head()
```

.footnote[<sup>1</sup> That's actually a `|` followed by a `>`. The default font on these slides just makes it look extra fancy.]

---
class: inverse, middle
name: dplyr

# dplyr


---

# Aside: Updating Packages

- Please make sure that you are running **at least dplyr 1.0.0** before continuing.
- 1.0.0 has been around for a while now (currently on 1.1.4), but if you have an old old version of dplyr, these functions won't be available
- As well, it's a good idea to frequently update all your packages!

```{r dplyr_vers, cache=FALSE}
packageVersion('dplyr')
# install.packages('dplyr') ## install updated version if < 1.0.0
```

--

*Note:* You can turn off .hi-slate[dplyr's] notifications about grouping variables with

```r
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE) ## Add to .Rprofile to make permanent
```


---

# Key dplyr Verbs

There are .hi-medgrn[five key dplyr verbs] that you need to learn.

1. `filter()`: Filter (i.e. subset) rows based on their values.

--

2. `arrange()`: Arrange (i.e. reorder) rows based on their values.

--

3. `select()`: Select (i.e. subset or arrange) columns by their names: 

--

4. `mutate()`: Create new columns or modify existing columns.

--

5. `summarise()`: Collapse multiple rows into a single summary value.<sup>2</sup>

.footnote[
<sup>2</sup> `summarize` with a "z" works too, R doesn't discriminate.
]

--

Let's practice these commands together using the `starwars` data frame that comes pre-packaged with dplyr. 

---
name: filter

# 1) dplyr::filter

We can chain multiple filter commands with the pipe (`%>%`), or just separate them within a single filter command using commas.
```{r filter1}
starwars %>% 
  filter( 
    species == "Human", # subset on exact match of string "Human" in species var
    height >= 190 # subset next on height continuous value
    ) 
```

---

# 1) dplyr::filter 

Regular expressions work well too. Using Base R:
```{r filter2}
starwars %>% 
  filter(grepl("Skywalker", name))
```


---

# 1) dplyr::filter 

Or .hi-slate[stringr] functions (the tidyverse string package)
  - Note the different argument order

```{r filter_stringr}
starwars %>% 
  filter(str_detect(name, "Skywalker"))
```
---

# Identifying Missing Data

A very common `filter` use case is identifying (or removing) observations with .hi-medgrn[missing values]
```{r filter3}
starwars %>% 
  filter(is.na(height)) %>%
  head()
```


---
# Removing Missing Data
To .hi-blue[remove missing observations], simply use negation: `filter(!is.na(height))`

Or use the convenient `drop_na()` verb:

```{r drop_na}
dim(starwars)

starwars %>% 
  drop_na(height) %>%
  dim()

identical(drop_na(starwars, height), filter(starwars, !is.na(height)))
```


---
name: arrange

# 2) dplyr::arrange

`arrange()` .hi-purple[arranges/sorts rows] based on values of a variable/variables
  * .hi-slate[numeric:] ascending order
  * .hi-slate[character:] alphabetically (try this on `name` variable)
  
```{r arrange1}
starwars %>% 
  arrange(birth_year) %>%
  head()
```

---

# 2) dplyr::arrange 

We can also arrange items in .hi-purple[descending order] using `desc()`.

```{r arrange2}
starwars %>% 
  arrange(desc(birth_year))
```
---

# 2) dplyr::arrange 

We can also nested sort by including multiple variables
  - Sort on first variable, then ties on the next, etc.
```{r arrange_nest}
starwars %>% 
  arrange(desc(birth_year), height) %>% head()
```


---
name: select

# 3) dplyr::select

`select()` lets you .hi-pink[subset columns by name/condition]
  * Use colons or `c()` to select multiple columns out of a data frame. (You can also use "first:last" for consecutive columns). 
  * Deselect columns with `-` in front of the name(s).
  * Variables will appear in the order you specify the arguments 
  
```{r select1}
starwars %>% 
  select(name:skin_color, species, -height)
```

---

# 3) dplyr::select 

You can also .hi-medgrn[rename] some (or all) of your selected variables in place.
```{r select2}
starwars %>%
  select(alias=name, crib=homeworld, gender) %>%
  head()
```
everything(), can be used at the end of the code above to still keep everything else in the data frame, just after the ones you selected for initially 
---

# dplyr::rename

Note: you can .hi-purple[rename columns] without subsetting with `rename`. Try this now by replacing `select(...)` in the above code chunk with `rename(...)`.

```{r rename, include = F}

```

---

# 3) dplyr::select 

The `select(contains(PATTERN))` option provides a nice shortcut to quickly select based on variable naming patterns
```{r select3}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, contains("color"))
```

---

# 3) dplyr::select

The `select(..., everything())` option is another useful shortcut if you only want to bring some variable(s) to the "front" of a data frame.

```{r select4}
starwars %>% 
  select(species, homeworld, everything()) %>%
  head(5)
```

---

# 3) dplyr::select 

.hi-slate[dplyr] has an entire group of .hi-medgrn[selection helpers] that can be used in many functions:


|  |  |
|---| ---|
| `starts_with("D")` | names starting with "D" |
| `ends_with("_hh")` | names ending with "_hh"|
| `contains("d")` | names containing "d" |
| ` matches("^[a-d]")` | names matching regular expression "^[a-d]" |
| `num_range(x, 1:10)` | names following pattern `x1`, `x2`, ..., `x10` |
| `all_of(vars)`/`any_of(vars)` | matches names stored in character vector `vars` |
| `last_col()` | further right column |
| `where(is.numeric)` | all variables where `is.numeric()` returns`TRUE` |

---

# Aside: dplyr::relocate

Note that the function `relocate()` uses the same syntax as `select()` to move .hi-medgrn[groups of columns at once.]

Add variables separated by commas to move them .hi-medgrn[to the front]

``` {r relocate}
starwars %>%
  relocate(
    ends_with("_color"), homeworld
  ) %>%
  head()
```

---

# Aside: dplyr::relocate

Can also use arguments `.after`/`.before` to place the column(s) in .hi-medgrn[specific locations]

``` {r relocate2}
starwars %>%
  relocate(
    species,
    .before = height
  ) %>%
  head()
```

---
name: mutate

# 4) dplyr::mutate

You can use `mutate()` to .hi-medgrn[create new columns] from scratch, or (more commonly) .hi-purple[transform existing columns].
```{r mutate1}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, birth_year) %>%
  mutate(dog_years = birth_year * 7) %>%
  head()
```

---
# 4) dplyr::mutate 

.hi-slate[Note:] `mutate()` is .hi-medgrn[order aware], so you can chain multiple mutates in a single call.
```{r mutate2}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, birth_year) %>%
  mutate(
    dog_years = birth_year * 7, ## Separate with a comma
    comment = paste0(name, " is ", dog_years, " in dog years.")
    ) %>% head()
```
paste vs paste0, paste will include the spaces and paste0 doesn't

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate 

Boolean, logical and conditional operators all work well with `mutate()` too.
```{r mutate3}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, height) %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Luke Skywalker", "Anakin Skywalker")) %>% 
  mutate(tall1 = height > 180) %>%
  mutate(tall2 = ifalse(height > 180, "Tall", "Short")) ## Same effect, but can choose labels

```

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate 

Lastly, combining `mutate()` with the recent `across()` feature<sup>3</sup> allows you to easily work on a .hi-blue[subset of variables]:

```{r, mutate4}
starwars %>% 
  select(name:eye_color) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), toupper)) %>% #<< 
  head(5)
```

.footnote[<sup>3</sup> This workflow (i.e. combining `mutate` and `across`) supersedes the old "scoped" variants of `mutate()` that you might have used previously]

---
# across

Alternatively, we can provide an "anonymous .hi-medgrn[lambda function] using syntax from the .hi-slate[purrr] package:
  - `~` to indicate we're building an anonymous lambda function 
  - `.x` the variables being passed in from `across()` 
  
```{r, lambda}
sw_4 <- select(starwars, name:eye_color) %>%
  mutate(mass = mass/100,
         height = height/10)

starwars %>% select(name:eye_color) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(height, mass),   ~ .x / 100)) %>% #<< 
  head(5)
```

---
name: summarise

# 5) dplyr::summarise

`summarise()` lets us .hi-blue[manually specify summary statistics]. It's particularly useful in combination with the `group_by()` command.

```{r summ1}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(species, gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))

#to drop the species that are na, we could use drop.na() with sepcification of what should g ointo the parentheses, if you don't it will cut any variables that have na. Can also use filter.is()
```

---

# 5) dplyr::summarise 

Note that including `na.rm = TRUE` (or `na.rm = T`) is usually a good idea, otherwise, missing values will result in `NA`
```{r summ2}
## Probably not what we want
starwars %>% 
  summarise(mean_height = mean(height))
```

---

# 5) dplyr::summarise 

Note that including `na.rm = TRUE` (or `na.rm = T`) is usually a good idea, otherwise, missing values will result in `NA`
```{r summ3}
## Much better
#na.rm = true removes those nas for us instead of just returning them as na again. I fyou add more arguments and you have more na then you need to add the na.rm again 
starwars %>% 
  summarise(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))
```
---

# 5) dplyr::summarise 

The same `across()`-based workflow that we saw with `mutate` a few slides back also works with `summarise`. For example:

```{r, summ4}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm=T)) %>% #<<
  head(5)
```

---

# 5) dplyr::summarise 

We can also specify .hi-blue[multiple summary functions] and .hi-medgrn[custom suffixes] by adding a .hi-red[list]:

```{r, summ5}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), 
                   list(Avg = mean, SD = sd), #<<
                   na.rm=T)) %>% head(5)
```

---

# Other dplyr Goodies: 

 `group_by()` and `ungroup()`: For (un)grouping.
- Particularly useful with the `summarise()` and `mutate()` commands, as we've already seen.

```{r ungroup}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
mutate(species_mass = mean(mass, na.rm = T),
       species_mass_diff = mass - species_mass) %>%
  select(name, starts_with("species")) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% head()

#this grouoing workflow persists unless you ungroup
```
---
# Other dplyr Goodies: slice

`slice()`: Subset rows by position rather than filtering by values.

```{r slice}
starwars %>% 
 slice(c(1,5))
```

---
# Other dplyr Goodies: pull

`pull()`: Extracts a column from a data frame as a vector or scalar.
  - grab by name or position (positive integer, L to R)
```{r pull}
starwars %>% 
  filter(gender=="feminine") %>% 
  pull(height)
```
Exactly like using .hi-medgrn[$], but works with pipes!

---
# Other dplyr Goodies: count and distinct

`count()` and `distinct()`: Number and isolate unique observations.

.pull-left[
```{r count}
starwars %>% count(species)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r dist}
starwars %>% distinct(species)
```
]

---
# Other dplyr Goodies: count and distinct

If we want to add the count as a variable to the full dataframe, we can use `group_by()`, `mutate()`, and `n()`:

```{r count_rep}
starwars %>% group_by(species) %>% mutate(num = n()) %>%
  select(name, species, num)
```


---

# Other dplyr Goodies: window functions

There is also a [whole class of window functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html) for getting leads and lags, ranking, creating cumulative aggregates, etc.
  - Generate leads and lags: `lag(species, 5)`, `lead(height)`
  - Create rankings: `row_number()`, `min_rank()`, `dense_rank()`, `cume_dist()`, `percent_rank()`, `ntile()`
  - Build cumulative aggregates: `cumsum()`, `cummin()`, `cummax()`, `cumall()`, `cumany()`, `cummean(`)
  - See `vignette("window-functions")`.

--


The final set of dplyr "goodies" are the family of .hi-purple[join operations]. However, these are important enough that I want to go over these concepts in a bit more depth...
- We will encounter and practice these many more times as the course progresses.


---
name: joins

# Joins

One of the mainstays of the dplyr package is merging data with the family [join operations](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/two-table.html).
- `inner_join(df1, df2)`
- `left_join(df1, df2)`
- `right_join(df1, df2)`
- `full_join(df1, df2)`
- `semi_join(df1, df2)`
- `anti_join(df1, df2)`

(You can find some helpful visual depictions of the different join operations [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html).)


---
# Joins


For our join examples, we'll use some data sets that come bundled with the [nycflights13](http://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) package.

- Load it now and then inspect these data frames<sup>4</sup> in your own console.

```{r flights, echo = F}
library(nycflights13)
```

.footnote[<sup>4</sup> These datasets are technically stored as tibbles, which are an [opinionated, modern version of data frames](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/). For our uses we can treat them essentially interchangeably, or forcibly go between types with `as.data.frame()/as.tibble()`
]

---
# Joins: Example Datasets

The `flights` dataset contains information on all flights that departed NYC in 2013:

```{r, eval = T}
head(flights)
```

---
# Joins: Example Datasets

The `planes` dataset contains metadata for all plane tailnumbers within the FAA aircraft registry 

```{r, eval = T}
head(planes)
```

---

# Joins

Let's perform a [left join](https://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html#left_joinsuperheroes-publishers) to bring variables from the planes dataset into the flights dataset.
- `left_join(df1, df2)` keeps all rows of `df1`, adds variables from `df2`
- .hi-slate[*Note*:] I'm subsetting columns, but only for the sake of slide legibility

--

```{r join1}
left_join(flights, planes) %>%
  select(year:dep_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, type, model, engine)
```

---

# Joins


Note that dplyr made a .hi-medgrn[reasonable guess] about which columns to join on (i.e. columns that .hi-medgrn[share the same name]). It also told us its choices: 

```
*## Joining, by = c("year", "tailnum")
```

However, there's an obvious problem here: the variable "year" does not have a consistent meaning across our joining datasets!
- In one it refers to the .hi-blue[year of flight], 
- In the other it refers to .hi-pink[year of construction]

--

Luckily, there's an easy way to avoid this problem. 
- See if you can figure it out before turning to the next slide.
- Try `?dplyr::join`.

# Joins: by

.hi-medgrn[Solution:] state explicitly which variables to join on by using the `by` argument.

  - You can also rename any ambiguous columns to avoid confusion


  
```{r join2b}
left_join(
  flights,
  planes %>% rename(year_built = year),
  by = "tailnum" ## Be specific about the joining column #<< 
  ) %>%
  select(year, month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, year_built, type, model) %>%
  head(3) ## Just to save vertical space on the slide
```

---

# Joins: Name Conflicts


Note what happens if we again specify the join column... but don't rename the ambiguous "year" column in at least one of the given data frames.
  
```{r join3}
left_join(
  flights,
  planes, ## Not renaming "year" to "year_built" this time
  by = "tailnum"
  ) %>%
  select(contains("year"), month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, type, model) %>%
  head(3)
```


Make sure you know what "year.x" and "year.y" are!

# Joining on Multiple Columns 

Often we need to join on .hi-medgrn[multiple variables] (i.e. unit and time for panels).

Two main ways to use `by` when merging on multiple columns:
  1. Rename matching columns before merging to have the same names
  1. Specify columns with different names to match on with
  
  .center[`by = c("yvar1" = "xvar1", "yvar2" = "xvar2", ...)`]
  
---

# Joining on Multiple Columns 

To see these, let's get info from the `weather` dataset:

```{r weather}
weather_sub <- select(weather, year, month, day, hour, temp, humid, starts_with("wind"))
```

This dataset contains info on the temperature, humidity, and wind conditions at each hour of the day in NYC during 2013 - useful information for understanding reasons for flight delays!
---

# Joining on Multiple Columns 
Suppose we want to have an approximation of the weather conditions before each flight. 
Since weather is only to the nearest hour, let's round flight departure to the closest hour<sup>5</sup>:

```{r flight_round}
flights <- mutate(flights,
                   dep_hr = case_when(
                     nchar(dep_time) == 3 ~ substr(dep_time,1,1) %>% as.numeric(),
                     nchar(dep_time) == 4 ~ substr(dep_time,1,2) %>% as.numeric(),
                     TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA)
                            )
                  )
```

.footnote[<sup>5</sup> I'm doing this to get to a starting point of different variable names - in reality we could just jump straight to merging on the same names here.]
---

# Joins: by (Renaming First)

Here we want to join on time (year, month, and departure hour).

We could begin by renaming `hour` in the weather dataset to match the flights data:
```{r join2a}
left_join(
  flights,
  weather_sub %>% rename(dep_hr = hour), ## Rename to match
  by = c("year", "month", "day", "dep_hr") ## Specify join columns
  ) %>%
  select(year, month, day, dep_hr, flight, temp, humid) %>%
  head(3) ## Just to save vertical space on the slide
```


---

# Joins: by (Merging on Different Names)

Alternatively, we could perform the same join without renaming (R will keep the X data's variable name for any naming differences)

```{r join_diffnames}
left_join(
  flights,
  weather_sub,
  by = c("year" = "year", "month" = "month", "day" = "day", "dep_hr" = "hour") ## Be specific about the joining column ("Xname" = "Yname")
  ) %>%
  select(year, month, day, dep_hr, flight, temp, humid) %>%
  head(3) ## Just to save vertical space on the slide
```

# Mutating Joins

.hi-medgrn[left joins] are probably the most common join we'll do, but we can perform a wide range of .hi-blue[mutating joins] with other join functions:

| Join Function | Description |
|----|----|
| `left_join(df1, df2)` | Add variables from `df2` into `df1` (keep all rows of `df1`)|
| `right_join(df1, df2)` | Add variables from `df1` into `df2` (keep all rows of `df2`)|
| `full_join(df1, df2)` | Combine `df1` and `df2` (keep all rows of `df1` and `df2`)|
| `inner_join(df1, df2)` | Keep only observations from `df1` with matches in `df2` |

---
# Filtering Joins

We can also perform .hi-purple[filtering joins] to restrict samples based on matches/non-matches across datasets:

| Join Function | Description |
|----|----|
| `semi_join(df1, df2)` | return all rows of `df1` with a match in `df2`|
| `anti_join(df1, df2)`|  return all rows of `df1` .hi-slate[without] a match in `df2`|

# Key tidyr verbs

1. `pivot_longer`: Pivot wide data into long format (i.e. "melt").<sup>6</sup> 

2. `pivot_wider`: Pivot long data into wide format (i.e. "cast").<sup>7</sup> 

3. `separate_wider_delim/separate_longer_delim`: Separate (i.e. split) one column into multiple columns/multiple rows.

4. `unite`: Unite (i.e. combine) multiple columns into one.

.footnote[
<sup>6</sup> Updated version of `tidyr::gather`.

<sup>7</sup> Updated version of `tidyr::spread`.

--

Let's practice these verbs together in class.
- Side question: Which of `pivot_longer` vs `pivot_wider` produces "tidy" data?


---
name: pivot_longer

# 1) tidyr::pivot_longer

Use `pivot_longer()` to go .hi-medgrn[from wide] .hi-purple[to long]<sup>8</sup>:
```{r pivot_longer1}
stocks <- data.frame( ## Could use "tibble" instead of "data.frame" if you prefer
  time = as.Date('2009-01-01') + 0:1,
  X = rnorm(2, 0, 1),
  Y = rnorm(2, 0, 2),
  Z = rnorm(2, 0, 4)
  )
stocks
```

---

# 1) tidyr::pivot_longer

Use `pivot_longer()` to go .hi-medgrn[from wide] .hi-purple[to long]<sup>8</sup>:
```{r pivot_longer2}
stocks %>% pivot_longer(-time, names_to="stock", values_to="price")
```
.footnote[<sup>8</sup> Note that both pivot functions have a lot of handy options for modifying names.]


---
name: pivot_longer

# 1) tidyr::pivot_longer

We could also manually specify the columns to pivot (useful when we want to pivot on just a subset of columns)

```{r pivot_longer1b}
stocks %>% pivot_longer(cols = c(X, Y, Z), names_to="stock", values_to="price")
```

---

# 1) tidyr::pivot_longer 

Let's quickly save the "tidy" (i.e. long) stocks data frame for use on the next slide. 

```{r pivot_longer3}
## Write out the argument names this time: i.e. "names_to=" and "values_to="
tidy_stocks <-  pivot_longer(stocks, -time, names_to="stock", values_to="price")
```


---
name: pivot_wider

# 2) tidyr::pivot_wider
Use `pivot_wider()` to go .hi-purple[from long] .hi-medgrn[to wide]:

```{r pivot_wider1}
tidy_stocks %>% pivot_wider(names_from=stock, values_from=price)
tidy_stocks %>% pivot_wider(names_from=time, values_from=price)
```

# Aside: Remembering the pivot_* syntax 

There's a long-running joke about no-one being able to remember Stata's "reshape" command. ([.hi-orange[Exhibit A]](https://twitter.com/helleringer143/status/1117234887902285836).)

It's easy to see this happening with the `pivot_*` functions too. However, I find that I never forget the commands as long as I remember the argument order is *"names"* then *"values"*.

name: separate

# 3)  Separate

tidyr has several `separate_direction_method` functions that make it easy to separate cells in a column into multiple columns/rows, where 
  * `direction` informs whether the data spread 
    * wide (`_wider_`) or 
    * expand each cell into multiple rows (`_longer_`)
  * `method` instructs the way to split a cell:
    * `delim` to split on a delimiter (i.e. "." or "/")
    * `position` to split at fixed widths
    * `regex` to split with a regular expression (i.e. `a(?<=d)` )

---
# 3)  Separate

Let's try splitting some economists' names.

```{r}
economists = data.frame(name = c("Adam.Smith", "Paul.Samuelson", "Milton.Friedman"))
economists
```
---
# 3) tidyr::separate_wider_delim

To split names into two columns by splitting at the period, we can use `separate_wider_delim`:

```{r sep1a}
economists %>% separate_wider_delim(name, # column(s) to separate
                 delim = ".", # delimiter to split on
                 names = c("first_name", "last_name")) # name of new variables
```

---

# 3) tidyr::separate_wider_regex

If you know regular expressions, you can use `separate_wider_regex` to accomplish the same task:

```{r sep1b}
economists %>% 
  separate_wider_regex(name, 
          patterns = c(first_name = "[:alpha:]+", ".", last_name = "[:alpha:]+")) 
```

---

# 3) tidyr::separate_longer_delim

A related function is `separate_longer_delim`, for splitting up cells that contain multiple fields or observations (a frustratingly common occurrence with survey data).

Let's see its use with some occupation data

```{r}
jobs <- data.frame(
  name = c("Jack", "Jill"),
  occupation = c("Homemaker", "Philosopher, Philanthropist, Troublemaker") 
  ) 
jobs
```
---
# 3) tidyr::separate_longer_delim

We can expand the data to have one row for each name and occupation combination:

```{r sep2}
## Now split out Jill's various occupations into different rows
jobs %>% separate_longer_delim(occupation, delim = ", ")
```


---
name: unite

# 4) tidyr::unite

`unite()` allows us to .hi-medgrn[collapse multiple columns into a single column]

Suppose we havedaily small business revenues:
```{r unite1}
rev <- data.frame(
  year = rep(2016, times = 4),
  month = rep(1, times = 4),
  day = 1:4,
  revenue = rnorm(4, mean = 100, sd = 10)
  )
rev 
```

---
# 4) tidyr::unite

We can use `unite` to combine the three date components into a single character column<sup>9</sup>:

```{r}
## Combine "yr", "mnth", and "dy" into one "date" column
rev_u <- rev %>% unite(col = date, # name of new column
              c("month", "day","year", ), # columns to unite
              sep = "-") # separator to use
rev_u
```
.footnote[<sup>9</sup> Set the argument `remove = T` to keep the original input columns]
---
# 4) tidyr::unite 

If we want to convert the new character column to another type (e.g. date or numeric) then you will need to modify it using `mutate`. 

--

For example, we can use the [.hi-orange[lubridate]](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) package's super helpful date conversion functions to convert our new variable to a date:

```{r}
#Need to read in manually 
pacman::p_load(lubridate)
rev_u <- mutate(rev_u, 
                date = mdy(date))
class(rev_u$date)
```

---

# Other tidyr goodies

Use `crossing` to get the full combination of a group of variables.<sup>10</sup>

```{r cross1}
crossing(side=c("left", "center", "right"), 
         height=c("top", "middle", "bottom"))
```

# Other tidyr goodies

Use `crossing` to get the full combination of a group of variables.<sup>11</sup>

```{r cross2, eval = F}
crossing(side=c("left", "center", "right"), 
         height=c("top", "middle", "bottom"))
```
