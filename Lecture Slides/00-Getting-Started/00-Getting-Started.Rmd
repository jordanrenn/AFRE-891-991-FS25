# GitHub Education

We'll be using GitHub throughout our course for version control, content delivery, and [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) for assignment submission.

To start, create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and register for a [student/educator  discount](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new)

  * In Week 2 we'll walk through how to sync the course repository using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/). Feel free to install it now too if you'd like, or wait to decide if it's right for you in Week 2.

# Course Website

Speaking of, I will be using this class [Github Repository](https://github.com/afre-msu/AFRE-891-991-FS25) to distribute all class materials. From here you can access course logistics, and all lecture-related files (i.e. slides and R Markdown files, datasets).

---
# Course Software

Throughout this course we will require a few pieces of (free!) software:

  * .hi-blue[R]
  * .hi-medgrn[RStudio]
  * **Windows:** .hi-red[RTools]
  * **Mac:** .hi-pink[macrtools]
  
You'll also need to create a [Github Education account](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new).

---
# R vs. RStudio

- .hi-medgrn[R] is the .hi-dkgrn[programming language]

- .hi-blue[RStudio] is the .hi-purple[environment] in which we use .hi-medgrn[R] 


---
# Installing R

To install .hi-medgrn[R], go to the [.hi-orange[R Project website]](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/).

- **Windows:** "R For Windows > Base > Download R # for Windows" 
 
- **Mac:** "R for (Mac) OS X > R-#.pkg"

- Where "#" is the current version number

# Installing RStudio

To install .hi-blue[RStudio], go to the [.hi-orange[RStudio Download Page]](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download)
.pull-left-sm[
- Scroll down, follow the link to install RStudio for your operating system. 
- Correct file should be linked under **2. Install RStudio**
- Can scroll further down to the entire list and download the version for Windows or Mac.

# Windows: Rtools

.hi-red[Rtools] is a toolchain bundle that will allow building R packages from source, which we'll need for installing packages that aren't listed on CRAN (i.e. only available direct from GitHub)

  * _Note:_ .hi-red[Rtools] is only for .hi-red[Windows]!
  
  
To install the current version of .hi-red[Rtools], navigate to the [Rtools website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/rtools.html), download the installer, and follow the prompts.


---
# Mac: macrtools

For Mac users, the .hi-pink[macrtools] replaces .hi-red[Rtools].

.hi-pink[macrtools] is a package that [installs the R toolchain for mac](https://github.com/coatless-mac/macrtools?tab=readme-ov-file)



To install, run

```{r macrtools, eval = F, include = T}
# install remotes if your don't already have it
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("coatless-mac/macrtools")
```

To install the R toolchain, run


```{r toolchain, eval = F, include = T}
macrtools::macos_rtools_install()
```


  


```{r gen_pdf, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
pagedown::chrome_print(input = "00-Getting-Started.html", timeout = 100)
```
